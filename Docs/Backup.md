# Steps to restore/move the full mod pack to another drive/computer:
1) Install a fresh copy of Skyrim from Steam, or a Steam backup.
2) Do all steps on the Getting Started page from the express guide.
3)  Copy/restore the two folders you selected in Automaton when you first installed the mod pack. (These are the important folders for  creating a backup)
     -  The primary mod pack folder where you installed Ult Sky, e.g. E:\US  or whatever else you used.  It's the folder that contains ModOrganizer.exe.
     -  [Optional] The **mod downloads folder**, which may or may not be inside the above folder.  (Strictly speaking, mod downloads folder isn't required to restore and play the mod pack, but it's recommended to keep a backup of the mod archives, in case you need to reinstall an individual mod or the entire mod pack without having to download the mods all over again.)
Copying the above two folders takes care of the Automaton portion of the express install guide.
4) Start MO from the Ult Sky folder, go into Settings > Paths, and make sure to update the paths for *Base Directory* and *Downloads*, with the above two folder paths.
5) Do the Final Steps from the express guide, except for the DLC cleaning step because you should already have a mod called "DLC - Cleaned" from your first installation.  That is, if you did everything correctly back then...  If you dont' have the cleaned DLCs, then do that step.
