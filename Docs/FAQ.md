# Q) Iâ€™m missing master for HighResTexturePack01-03 or My game CTD after Skyrim Logo

A) If you are experiencing a missing master for HighResTexturePack01-03 the simplest fix is to download and enable the High Res DLC from https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/

Alternatively, you can re-run the reqtificator to generate a new Requiem For The Indiferent.esp (RFTI) without the High Res DLC as a master. This will be fixed in the next release.
